1.  Introduction

   [RFC1035] and other documents defined some Resource Record (RR) Types
   that are no longer in common use, some of which have been rendered
   obsolete by subsequent standards, but have never been clearly
   deprecated in the context of the DNS.  In some cases there have been
   interoperability problems between DNS implementations that support
   these types and those that do not - for example, because of DNS name
   compression in the wire format.  Continued support for these RR Types
   imposes a complexity cost on new implementations for little benefit.

   This document formally deprecates these RR Types, allowing
   implementations to drop specific support for them.

2.  Deprecating MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types

   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types are not used
   in any existing standards, and this document deprecates their usage.

   RDATA fields for MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR Types contain
   domain names.  DNS compression MUST NOT be applied to these domain
   names when sending.

   As an update to [RFC3597] and [RFC4034], this document updates the
   specifications of the canonical forms for the MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and
   MINFO RR Types such that they do NOT include downcasing of embedded
   domain names.  Canonical forms otherwise remain as specified in
   [RFC4034] section 6.2.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This documents updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" ([DNS-IANA]).

              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | TYPE  | Value | Meaning    | Reference     |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MD    | 3     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MF    | 4     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MB    | 7     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MG    | 8     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MR    | 9     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MINFO | 14    | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MAILB | 253   | DEPRECATED | This document |
              | MAILA | 254   | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Types will be flagged as obsolete/deprecated in the IANA registry,
   and the following guidance is given to DNS implementors in the
   handling of obsolete/deprecated RR types:

   1.  Authoritative DNS Servers SHOULD issue a warning when loading
       zones that contain DEPRECATED RR Types;

   2.  DNS Servers MUST NOT compress RDATA when rendering DEPRECATED RR
       Types to wire format;

   3.  Recursive DNS Servers MAY support legacy compression in
       DEPRECATED RR Types for received data for backward compatibility
       if desired, but SHOULD warn if such information is received.
       Compressed RDATA in DEPRECATED RR Types MUST be uncompressed
       before sending, and MUST NOT be re-transmitted in compressed
       form;

   4.  DNS Clients which receive DEPRECATED RR Types MAY interpret them
       as unknown RR Types ([RFC3597]), and MUST NOT interfere with
       their transmission;

   5.  DNSSEC Validators and Signers SHOULD treat RDATA for DEPRECATED
       RR Types as opaque with respect to canonical RR ordering and
       deduplication;

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

6.  Operational Considerations

   Varying states of implementation of MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR
   Types have already caused operational problems between DNS
   implementations that do, and do not, implement them, as a result of
   differing behavior with respect to DNS compression on the wire.  This
   document aims to rectify the situation by encouraging removal of
   support for all these RR types in DNS implementations.  This should
   cause few if any operational problems, because these types are not in
   use on the Internet.  [COMMENT: Some data?]
