1.  Introduction

   [RFC1035] and other documents have defined some Resource Record (RR)
   Types that are no longer in common use, some of which have been
   rendered obsolete by subsequent standards, but have never been
   clearly deprecated in the context of the DNS.  In some cases there
   have been interoperability problems between DNS implementations that
   support these types and those that do not - for example, because of
   DNS name compression in the wire format.  Continued support for these
   RR Types imposes a complexity cost on new implementations for little
   benefit.

   This document formally deprecates such RR Types, allowing
   implementations to drop specific support for them.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Deprecating MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types

   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types aren't used
   in any existing standards, and this documents deprecates their usage.
   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR Types RDATA contain a domain
   name that could be compressed in the RDATA section.

   As an update to [RFC3597] and [RFC4034] this document specifies that
   for MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR types, the canonical form is
   such that no downcasing of embedded domain names takes place, and is
   otherwise identical to the canonical form specified in 6.2.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" ([DNS-IANA]) as follows:

              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | TYPE  | Value | Meaning    | Reference     |
              +=======+=======+============+===============+
              | MD    | 3     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MF    | 4     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MB    | 7     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MG    | 8     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MR    | 9     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MINFO | 14    | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Obsolete types will be flagged as DEPRECATED in the IANA registry,
   and the following guidance is given to DNS implementors in the
   handling of these RR types:

   1.  Authoritative DNS Servers SHOULD issue a warning when loading
       zones that contain DEPRECATED RR Types;

   2.  DNS Servers MUST NOT compress RDATA when rendering DEPRECATED RR
       Types to wire format;

   3.  Recursive DNS Servers MAY support legacy compression in
       DEPRECATED RR Types for received data for backward compatibility
       if desired, but SHOULD warn if such information is received.
       Compressed RDATA in DEPRECATED RR Types MUST be uncompressed
       before sending and they MUST NOT be re-transmitted;

   4.  DNS Clients which receive DEPRECATED RR Types MAY interpret them
       as unknown RR types ([RFC3597]), and MUST NOT interfere with
       their transmission;

   5.  DNSSEC Validators and Signers SHOULD treat RDATA for DEPRECATED
       RR Types as opaque with respect to canonical RR ordering and
       deduplication;

   6.  DEPRECATED RR Types MUST NOT be treated as a known type with
       respect to the wire protocol.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The varying states of implementation of MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO
   RR Types have already caused operational problems between DNS
   implementations that do implement the aforementioned types and those
   that don't, because of mismatched handling of DNS compression on the
   wire.  This document aims to rectify the situation by encouraging
   removal of support for all these RR types in all DNS implementations.
   This should not cause signficant operational problems because these
   records are not in wide use on the Internet.  [COMMENT: Some data?]
